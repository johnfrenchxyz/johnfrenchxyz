    <h1>John French - Experience Director</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm John. I am currently the Director of User Experience for the Department of Veterans Affairs Business
        Unit at Ad Hoc LLC. I have over fifteen years of UX industry experience, including time leading teams of Designers, Researchers, Content Designers, and Accessibility Specialists as well as leading delivery efforts on web applications, digital services, and APIs on a variety of cross-functional teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have worked to help apply to Human-Centered Design best-practices on contracts with the VA, Library of Congress, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Social Security Administration, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and more. I also help support recruitment, growth, and business development efforts for multiple portfolios at Ad Hoc. 
    </p>    
    <p>    
        Previously in my career, I was the UX Design Lead for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) PACA/DC Geo and Blue Button 2.0 API platforms, leading efforts to utilize Medicare claims data to help improve healthcare outcomes for people with Medicare, while reducing costs for providers and Accountable Care Organizations and improving outcomes for insurers.
    </p>    
        My professional experience is rooted in web development, giving me the ability to work seamlessly with developers and engineers on complex technological challenges, as well as with non-technical peers and end-users. As a member of industry-leading interoperability efforts, I helped solidify API best practices with the CMS Human-Centered Design and API community initiatives, and helped start Ad Hoc’s API Community of Practice. John brings the ideals and best-in-practice methodologies of service design to government services, APIs, and teams.
