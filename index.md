I am Senior UX Designer and Front-End Specialist at [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team). I currently help build and improve the [Blue Button 2.0 API](https://bluebutton.cms.gov) for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Formerly, I created tools and resources for Georgia citizens with UGA Extension and UGA CAES. 

I am passionate about digital rights and privacy, inclusive design, and accessibility. You can read some of my writing on the [Ad Hoc Blog](https://adhoc.team/blog/).
